### Message 1

You asked about what do you envision the local AI as an MCP client.

What I am doing is, so basically, how does Cursor use, how does Cursor call the MCP server?

It already has in the MCP, the JSON, it has how to run the commands to run the server, this and that.

So when you ask a question, so this is what I want. I think this combining agents and MCP clients together, if I'm not mistaken.

You ask a question, and you don't even need to tell that to use the MCP tool.

You ask a question, and it automatically decides I will be using the MCP tool.

It will call the MCP tool.

And because it already knows that this question relates to that is actually needed, the MCP tool is needed to ask that question.

So let me give you an example, the weather.

There is a weather tool.

There is a weather API where the MCP tool hits the weather API, it gets all the images.

When you ask, what is the weather, it will give you what is the weather.

Because it already knows that it has the MCP tool, it calls the tool, and gives you the weather.

So that is kind of what I envision, what I want, basically.

But I actually think that we can combine the MCP client along with AI agents, something like that.

That's my kind of envisioning in that sense.

But yeah, for the back end, I'm pretty confident in the back end, the fastest I can really.

But I want the MCP tool to be as kind of, the MCP tool is the one that controls, or like, if you use the MCP tool, for example, we understand that we have, for example, we have textual rags and visual textual rags, we can say, that the diagrams are converted into descriptions.

So how will, for example, when you ask a question, how will, who will decide which database to go to?

How is it going to happen?

That is my question to you.

How will that happen?

What do we use?

Are we going to use the agents, the MCP client?

Because if the MCP client is intelligent enough without any agent or this one or that to identify that this is the fast API that we've got to hit, or this is the fast API endpoint that we've got to hit.

What is the, what is, how does that happen again?

You've hit on a crucial point, and your intuition about combining the MCP client concept with AI agent capabilities is spot on for achieving the kind of intelligent, automatic tool use you're describing, similar to how you perceive advanced systems like Cursor operating.

Let's clarify how this would work in the architecture we've been discussing, specifically addressing your excellent question: "When you ask a question, how will, who will decide which database to go to (textual RAGs vs. visual textual RAGs)? How is it going to happen? What do we use? Are we going to use the agents, the MCP client?"

Here's how the decision process would flow, integrating the concepts of an intelligent MCP client and specialized tools/agents:

**User Query (AG-UI - Vue.js - Phase 4):**

The user types a question, for example, "What were the critical alarms for pump P-101 last week?" or "Show me the control schematic for the primary cooling circuit."

**"Local AI" (MCP Client / Agent - Phase 3): The Initial Decision to Use a Tool**

This component, which is a FastAPI application itself, receives the raw query from your AG-UI.

This is where your vision of automatic tool use comes into play. The "Local AI" is more than just a passive client. It embodies a degree of agentic behavior. It needs to:

1. **Understand the Query's Nature (Broadly)**: It recognizes that the query isn't something it can answer from its own (hypothetical) internal knowledge or a simple chat history. It understands the query requires accessing your specialized knowledge bases (alarms or diagrams).

2. **Tool Selection**: Based on its programming or a simple classification step, it decides that the best way to handle this type of query is to use the IntelligentQueryRouterTool that you've planned for the MCP Server. It knows about this tool from its configuration (e.g., the mcp.json file mentioned in the plan).

3. **Invoking the Tool**: It then acts as an MCP client to make a request to the IntelligentQueryRouterTool on the MCP Server, passing the user's original query.

So, to your point: The "Local AI" (your Phase 3 FastAPI app) doesn't necessarily decide which specific database to hit directly at this stage. Instead, its intelligence lies in recognizing which specialized tool (or agent) is needed to make that more granular decision. It says, "This query needs routing; I'll send it to the router tool."

**MCP Server & the IntelligentQueryRouterTool (Agent - Phase 2): The Specific Routing Decision**

1. The MCP Server receives the request at the /tools/intelligent_query_router endpoint.
2. This IntelligentQueryRouterTool is the specialized AI agent responsible for deciding which database to query.
3. It takes the user's query (received from the "Local AI") and applies its internal logic, as outlined in the Phase 2 plan:
   - **Option A (Heuristics)**: It checks for keywords like "diagram," "schematic" vs. "alarm," "error."
   - **Option B (Small LLM Router)**: It could pass the query to another, smaller, local LLM (e.g., a fine-tuned Mistral 7B or Phi-3 model) with a prompt like: "Classify whether the following user query is primarily about 'diagrams' or 'textual_alarms'. User Query: '{user_query}'. Respond with only 'DIAGRAMS' or 'TEXTUAL_ALARMS'."
   - **Option C (Hybrid)**: A combination of both.
4. Based on this decision, the IntelligentQueryRouterTool then makes a new HTTP request to the appropriate endpoint on your core FastAPI Backend (Phase 1) â€“ either /query_text_alarms or /query_diagrams.

**Core Backend (FastAPI - Phase 1): Data Retrieval**

This backend service receives the request from the IntelligentQueryRouterTool and performs the actual query against the specified Chroma DB.
It returns the raw retrieved data (text chunks or diagram information) back to the IntelligentQueryRouterTool.

**Response Aggregation & Final Answer Generation:**

1. The IntelligentQueryRouterTool receives the data from the Phase 1 backend. It might do some minimal formatting and then sends a response back to the "Local AI" (MCP Client), indicating which source was queried and the retrieved data.
2. The "Local AI" (MCP Client) receives this structured response.
3. **Initially (simple)**: It might just pass this data directly to the AG-UI.
4. **Advanced (Phase 6)**: This is where the "Local AI" could invoke another LLM (your main generator LLM, like the llama3.2-vision:11b) to synthesize a conversational answer based on the retrieved context before sending it to the AG-UI.

In summary, to answer your direct question:

**Who decides which database to go to?**
The IntelligentQueryRouterTool (which is an AI agent hosted on your MCP Server) makes the specific decision of "text alarm DB" vs. "diagram DB."

**How does it happen?**
1. The user query goes to the "Local AI."
2. The "Local AI" (acting as an intelligent MCP client/agent) recognizes the need for specialized routing and calls the IntelligentQueryRouterTool.
3. The IntelligentQueryRouterTool analyzes the query (using heuristics or an LLM) and then calls the correct endpoint on your Phase 1 FastAPI backend.

**What do we use? Agents? MCP Client?**
You use both, working together:
- Your "Local AI" acts as an intelligent MCP client and a lightweight orchestrating agent. Its "intelligence" is in knowing which MCP tool/agent to call (e.g., the router tool for queries needing knowledge base lookup).
- The IntelligentQueryRouterTool is a specialized AI agent residing on the MCP Server. Its "intelligence" is focused on the specific task of query analysis and routing.

This layered approach allows for specialized intelligence at different points. The "Local AI" doesn't need to know the intricate details of how routing is done; it just needs to know who to ask (the router tool). The router tool, in turn, focuses solely on making the best routing decision.

Does this breakdown clarify how the decision-making process can be distributed across these components, aligning with your vision of an intelligent client that automatically leverages specialized tools? What are your thoughts on this flow, particularly on where the "intelligence" for different decisions should reside?

### Message 2

That is a great, I love the explanation. I love the plan, love the idea. But my question is this,

when people say agentic rag, what does that mean? Does this embed agentic rag or how is that exactly possible? For example, let's say in this scenario, in my project, we don't need to hit the web or anything like that. But let's say we need to hit the web. Let's say we need to, for example, postgres database. We need to search in the web system. So how is agentic rag working here?

When people say agentic rag, what exactly does agentic rag mean? And this is what we are doing, what we are talking about with the MCP, with the intelligent query, query doctor tool. Does that qualify as an agentic rag? That is my question. For example, I was thinking this. Let's say you have, we have, you know, four or five models, each really specializing in maybe one in summary, one in giving instructions, one in answering long questions, one in this, one in that.

Let's say I want to maybe have something that decides, okay, this is the next question. We can maybe use this LLM to answer the question because it's more summary. It needs an LLM which has more, which gives us summary. Or we have an LLM which, you know, understands people's documents, technical words more, or something like that. So how would that be also? That is my question as well

You're asking some fantastic questions that get to the heart of where the AI field is moving, especially with RAG. Let's clarify "Agentic RAG" and see how it applies to what we're designing.

**What is Agentic RAG?**

At its core, Agentic RAG embeds autonomous or semi-autonomous AI agents into the Retrieval-Augmented Generation process. Instead of a fixed, linear pipeline (retrieve -> augment -> generate), Agentic RAG introduces an AI agent (or multiple agents) that can dynamically plan, make decisions, use various tools, and potentially iterate to fulfill a user's request or solve a problem.

Key characteristics and capabilities often associated with Agentic RAG include:

1. **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Agents can decide if retrieval is needed, what to retrieve, from which source, and which tools to use. They might even decide to re-try a step with different parameters if the initial results aren't good.

2. **Tool Use**: This is fundamental. Agents can leverage a diverse set of "tools". These tools can be: 
   - Traditional RAG pipelines (like the ones you're building for text and diagrams).
   - Web search engines.
   - Database query interfaces (e.g., to your Postgres database).
   - Code interpreters.
   - Other APIs (like a weather API).
   - Even other LLMs or specialized models.

3. **Planning & Multi-Step Reasoning**: For complex queries, an agent might break down the problem into sub-tasks, execute them sequentially or in parallel (often using different tools for different sub-tasks), and then synthesize the results. Frameworks like ReAct (Reason-Act) enable agents to iterate through thought, action, and observation cycles.

4. **Reflection & Self-Correction**: More advanced agents can critique their own outputs or the information they've retrieved, identify flaws, and attempt to correct them, possibly by re-querying or using a different approach.

5. **Dynamic Adaptation**: The agent can change its strategy based on the query's complexity, the context, or intermediate results.

Essentially, Agentic RAG moves beyond simply fetching and stuffing context into a prompt. It introduces a reasoning layer that actively manages and utilizes information and tools to achieve a goal.

**Does Your Current Plan Embody Agentic RAG?**

Yes, your current plan definitely incorporates foundational elements of Agentic RAG, particularly through the IntelligentQueryRouterTool and the intended intelligence of your "Local AI" (MCP Client).

**IntelligentQueryRouterTool as a Specialized Agent:**
- This tool acts as a specialized agent. Its defined task is to analyze a query and decide which knowledge base (textual alarms or diagrams) to consult. This is a form of autonomous decision-making regarding data source selection.
- The plan for it to use heuristics or an LLM for this decision means it's performing a reasoning step.
- It then "acts" by invoking the appropriate backend service.

**"Local AI" (MCP Client) as an Orchestrating Agent (Implicitly):**
- You envision it automatically deciding to use the IntelligentQueryRouterTool without the user explicitly stating "use the router." This is a simple form of agentic behavior â€“ it recognizes a task type ("this query needs knowledge base lookup") and selects the appropriate tool.
- In Phase 6, when this "Local AI" component uses a generator LLM to synthesize answers, it's performing another step in a more complex RAG chain.

So, the system we're designing has a rudimentary agentic loop:
User Query -> "Local AI" (Orchestrator Agent) decides "use Router Tool" -> IntelligentQueryRouterTool (Specialized Routing Agent) decides "use Text DB" -> Retrieval -> Data back to "Local AI" -> "Local AI" (potentially using Generator LLM) crafts final response.

This is a valid and common starting point for Agentic RAG. It's not yet doing complex multi-step planning or self-correction, but the core idea of an AI component making decisions about how to use other components (tools/services) is there.

**How Agentic RAG Handles External Tools (Web, Postgres):**

Let's take your examples:

**Needing to Hit the Web:**
- You would define a new "WebSearchTool" and host it on your MCP Server (or it could be an external service your agent knows how to call). This tool would take a search query and return, say, the top N search results or summaries.
- Your "Local AI" (the orchestrating agent) would be enhanced. When a query comes in (e.g., "What's the latest news on NVIDIA's Blackwell GPU?"), it would:
  - Recognize that this query cannot be answered by your internal alarm or diagram DBs.
  - Decide to use the "WebSearchTool."
  - Call the "WebSearchTool" with an appropriate search query (which it might even generate from the user's natural language question).
  - Get the search results back.
  - Then, it might feed these search results as context to your generator LLM to provide a summarized answer to the user.

**Needing to Query a Postgres Database:**
- Similarly, you'd define a "PostgresQueryTool" on your MCP Server. This tool would be capable of constructing and executing SQL queries against your Postgres DB (safely, of course, perhaps with predefined query templates or a natural language to SQL capability).
- The "Local AI" agent, when faced with a query like "What's the current inventory level for part XYZ in the main warehouse?", would recognize this needs the Postgres DB, select the "PostgresQueryTool," formulate the request for it, and process the returned structured data.

In both cases, the "agent" (your "Local AI") is making an intelligent decision to use a specific tool based on the query's nature. The MCP Server makes these tools available in a standardized way.

**Routing to Different Specialized LLMs (Your Example):**

This is an excellent use case for Agentic RAG and fits beautifully into your architecture!

**Vision:** You have multiple LLMs, each specialized (e.g., LLM_Summarizer, LLM_TechnicalExplainer, LLM_InstructionFollower).

**Implementation:**
- These specialized LLMs could each be exposed as separate "tools" or services, potentially via your MCP Server or managed directly by the "Local AI" if they are all local Ollama instances.
- Your "Local AI" (acting as the primary orchestrating agent) or a dedicated new "LLMSelectionAgent" (which could itself be an MCP tool) would be responsible for this.
- When the "Local AI" has retrieved context (e.g., from the IntelligentQueryRouterTool) and needs to generate a response, it (or the LLMSelectionAgent) would analyze the task type or the user's intent along with the retrieved context.
  - "User asks for a summary of these documents." -> Select LLM_Summarizer.
  - "User asks for a step-by-step guide based on this technical procedure." -> Select LLM_InstructionFollower.
  - "User asks for an explanation of a complex term found in the diagrams." -> Select LLM_TechnicalExplainer.
- The agent then routes the context and the generation task to the chosen LLM.

This routing to specialized LLMs is a more advanced form of the IntelligentQueryRouterTool â€“ instead of routing to a data source, it's routing to a specific processing (generation) resource. It's a perfect example of an agent making a decision to optimize the outcome by selecting the best "tool" (in this case, the best LLM) for the job at hand.

**In conclusion:**

- Yes, the system you're designing, especially with the IntelligentQueryRouterTool and the "Local AI" making decisions about tool use, is an early-stage but definite form of Agentic RAG.
- Agentic RAG fundamentally means having AI components that can autonomously decide how to go about answering a query or completing a task, including which tools (data sources, external APIs, other models) to use and in what sequence.
- Your architecture (MCP Client/Server, FastAPI services) is an excellent foundation for building increasingly sophisticated agentic capabilities, like accessing web search, other databases, or routing tasks to specialized LLMs.

This is a very powerful paradigm. The key is to start with a well-defined agent (like your router) and then incrementally add more tools and more sophisticated decision-making capabilities to your agents over time.

### Message 3

And also, of course, based on the agentic rag, we can easily add those multi-steps, making it a smaller task, or rewriting the query, blah, blah, blah. We can add all of those later.

After we have done maybe the MCP server and tool and stuff like that, we can add those later.

### Nexus AI Response

Absolutely, you've got it exactly right.

Once you have the foundational MCP server/client architecture in place, with the ability for your "Local AI" (acting as an orchestrating agent) to call tools on the MCP server, adding more sophisticated agentic behaviors becomes a natural evolution.

Things like:

**Multi-step Task Decomposition:** An agent within your "Local AI" or even a specialized "Planning Agent" (another MCP tool) could look at a complex user query and break it down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. Each sub-task could then involve calling different MCP tools (your router, a web search tool, a summarizer, etc.).

**Query Rewriting/Expansion:** Before even calling the IntelligentQueryRouterTool, your "Local AI" could employ another small LLM or a dedicated "Query Refinement Tool" (again, potentially an MCP tool) to rewrite the user's query for better clarity or to expand it with relevant terms, improving retrieval accuracy. This directly aligns with the techniques discussed in your "Advanced RAG Technique Analysis" document.

**Iterative Refinement (ReAct-style loops):** For more complex scenarios, an agent could perform an action (like querying a database), observe the results, reason about whether those results are sufficient, and then decide on a next action (e.g., refine the query, try a different database, or synthesize the answer).

The MCP architecture provides the building blocks (the tools). The agentic layer provides the intelligence to decide how and when to use those blocks, and in what sequence.

So yes, establishing the MCP server and the initial IntelligentQueryRouterTool is a critical step. Once that's functional, you have a flexible framework to incrementally add these more advanced agentic capabilities, like multi-step reasoning and query transformation, enhancing the system's overall intelligence and problem-solving ability.
